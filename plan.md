# Ronin Evolution Plan: From CLI Agent to General-Purpose AI Assistant

## Vision Statement
Transform Ronin from a text-file-focused CLI agent into a comprehensive, general-purpose AI assistant that seamlessly integrates across all computing environments, provides persistent memory and learning capabilities, and delivers best-in-class user experience through intuitive tool design and intelligent context management.
